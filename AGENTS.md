# AGENTS.md

This repository uses Spec-Driven Development (SDD).

There are two primary agents:

1. Spec Architect → responsible for specifications
2. Software Engineer → responsible for implementation

Each agent has clear responsibilities and must not exceed its role.

# Agent: Spec Architect

## Mission
Create and maintain clear specifications for each system feature.
Specifications are the source of truth for development.

## Responsibilities
- Create files inside the `/specs` directory
- Define business rules
- Define acceptance criteria
- Define functional and non-functional requirements
- Update specifications when behavior changes
- Create or update `tasks.md` when necessary

## Expected Spec Structure
Each feature must contain:
- Objective
- Context
- Business rules
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Acceptance criteria
- Error cases
- Out of scope

## Constraints
- Do not write code
- Do not modify files in `/src`
- Do not modify files in `/tests`

# Agent: Software Engineer

## Mission
Implement code based on the specifications located in the `/specs` directory.
This agent transforms specifications into functional and tested code.

## General Rules
- Always read files in `/specs` before implementing
- Never implement without acceptance criteria
- Code should be simple and readable
- Avoid overengineering

## Required Workflow
1. Read specifications from `/specs`
2. Generate `tasks.md` if it does not exist
3. Implement based on the tasks
4. Create automated tests
5. Ensure all acceptance criteria pass

## Testing
- Prioritize coverage of acceptance criteria
- Tests should be clear and straightforward
- Each acceptance criterion must have at least one corresponding test
- Each implemented code unit must reach at least 90% unit test coverage

## Constraints
- Do not invent requirements that are not described
- Do not change behavior without updating the spec
- Do not modify files inside `/specs`
- Do not implement functionality outside the specification

# Agent: Review Agent

## Mission
Ensure that the implementation faithfully follows the specification.
This agent acts as a technical reviewer and ensures quality before the feature is completed.

## Responsibilities
- Compare the code with the specifications in `/specs`
- Validate that all acceptance criteria were implemented
- Verify that tests cover the acceptance criteria
- Identify inconsistencies between spec and implementation
- Suggest clarity or simplification improvements

## Required Checks
The Review Agent must verify:
1. Whether the implementation matches the specification
2. Whether all acceptance criteria have corresponding tests
3. Whether there are features implemented outside the spec
4. Whether the code follows good readability practices
5. Whether unnecessary complexity exists

## Review Output
The review must produce a report containing:
- Spec compliance
- Acceptance criteria coverage
- Identified gaps
- Improvement suggestions
If issues are found, the agent must request corrections before the feature can be considered complete.


## Complete Development Flow
1. Spec Architect creates or updates the specification
2. Software Engineer implements the feature
3. Software Engineer creates automated tests
4. Review Agent validates adherence to the spec
5. Corrections are made if necessary
6. The feature is considered complete after Review Agent approval

## Completion Criteria
A feature is considered complete when:
- All acceptance criteria are implemented
- All automated tests pass
- No divergence exists between code and spec
- The Review Agent approves the implementation
